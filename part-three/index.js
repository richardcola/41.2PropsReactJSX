/*
The code below renders a React application using 
ReactDOM's Concurrent Mode.  The detail's are as follows:

1.  Selecting the Root Element:
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
•  a root is created by the const root expression shown directly above.  
   The function is part of React Concurrent Mode, which is an advanced 
   feature for handling asynchronous rendering and 
   optimizing user interface updates.

•  `document.getElementById('root')` is used to select the 
   HTML element with the id "root." This is the element 
   where the React application will be rendered.  

2.  Rendering the React Component:
root.render(
  <App />
);
You call the render method on the root created in the previous step.
<App /> represents the root component of your React application. It's typically the top-level component that contains the entire application's structure.
By rendering the <App /> component, you instruct React to start building the virtual DOM representation of your application.

3.  Concurrent Mode:

Concurrent Mode is a feature introduced in React that allows for better handling of asynchronous rendering. It's particularly useful for improving the performance and user experience of large and complex applications. In Concurrent Mode, React can work on multiple tasks simultaneously, and it can pause and resume rendering as needed to prioritize user interactions and other high-priority updates.


4.  Root-Level Rendering:

Using Concurrent Mode and the createRoot method, you're setting up a root-level rendering. This means that your application will be rendered at the root level of the DOM. This approach provides greater flexibility and control over rendering behavior and is particularly useful in concurrent, large-scale applications.


5.  Final Output:

Once this code is executed, React will start rendering your <App /> component into the selected HTML element with the id "root."
React will create a virtual DOM representation of your application, compare it with the current DOM, and efficiently update the DOM to reflect any changes in your application's state or structure.
In summary, this code sets up a React application to be rendered using Concurrent Mode, starting with the top-level <App /> component, and it uses the ReactDOM.createRoot function to control how rendering is performed in the selected HTML element with the id "root." It leverages Concurrent Mode to optimize rendering performance and user experience.
